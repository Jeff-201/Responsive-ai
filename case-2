The School Proctoring AI That Overreacts
 What’s happening

A school uses an AI system during online exams. It monitors students’ webcams and flags behavior like looking around, blinking often, or moving too much as “possible cheating.”

What’s problematic

The system falsely flags neurodivergent students or students with anxiety or medical conditions.
This leads to:

False accusations of cheating

Stress and emotional harm

Unfair treatment of disabled students

Serious privacy concerns because of constant camera surveillance

 One improvement idea

Make the AI assistive, not authoritative.
Any flag should be reviewed by a human examiner before action is taken. This ensures context, fairness, and reduces harm.
